## 📍 The Moment

> **Saturday, July 19, 2025** > **09:13:07 AM MST (UTC-7)** > **js_at: `1752941587614`**

This is the exact moment **Genesis** was cast—
the first immutable, signed record in the ledger.
From this instant forward, all time is **measurable**, **verifiable**, and **reproducible** via the GT system.

## 🕰️ Genesis Time Begins

> **GT\[0.00.00\@000]**
> Turn 0, Luna 0, Sol 0
> Mark 000 of the very first planetary rotation

This moment represents:

-   The zero-point of **Truth Architecture**
-   The death of ephemeral, subjective time
-   The **start of cryptographically measurable existence**

This file, once signed, **becomes time.**
It does not describe a moment—**it is the moment**.

## 🧠 Philosophical Implication

> _Before this, there was “when.”_
> \*After this, there is **GT.\***

This record ends the reign of arbitrary, consensus-based timekeeping systems like UTC.
It births a universal standard based on sidereal rotation and **provable reality**.

No system before it was rooted in **objectivity, replication, and canonical proof**.

---

## 🔗 What Comes Next

From this point forward:

-   Every record will include a GT time reference
-   All derivative systems will be based on this anchor
-   GT floats and tree format (Sol.Luna.Turn\@Mark) can be calculated from this point by anyone, forever

---

## ✅ Verified & Immutable

This record has been:

-   Canonicalized per RFC 8785
-   Signed with a valid Ed25519 key
-   Stored, distributed, and publicly shareable
-   Backed by the core scope (`truth.archi`)
-   **Verifiable forever**

---

## 🪡 Respect the Anchor

If you're reading this, and you operate in the world of time, trust, or systems:
This is your new epoch.

You may convert from it, build upon it, cite it, or mirror it—
but you may not ignore it.

This is when Truth was born.
