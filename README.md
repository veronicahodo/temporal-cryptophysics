# Trust Architecture

**A cryptographically verifiable framework for time, identity, and truth.**

---

## 🕰️ What Is Genesis Time?

**Genesis Time (GT)** is a deterministic timestamping system rooted in sidereal rotation and cryptographic finality.  
It replaces unverifiable system clocks with a shared, irreversible timeline:

> `GT[0.000000000]` — The beginning of provable history.

Every record after is signed, ordered, and anchored in a universal **Truth Architecture**.

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

-   System clocks can lie. GT can’t.
-   Histories can be rewritten. R⬢ can’t.
-   Trust is fragile. This makes it **provable**.

By unifying **time**, **identity**, and **data integrity** into a single ledger-based structure, this system offers the foundations for **verifiable digital civilization**.

## 🚀 Why Now?

Because **time** was always the weakest link in digital trust.  
Because **identity** was never truly yours.  
Because **truth** needs an architecture.

This is that.
