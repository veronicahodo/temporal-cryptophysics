# Temporal Cryptophysics

**A new science, born from code and cryptography, that redefines how we measure, prove, and trust time.**

## ⏱️ What Is Temporal Cryptophysics?

Temporal Cryptophysics (TC) is a field that combines **cryptographic immutability**, **physics-based precision**, and **ledger-based accountability** to create a **new, absolute measurement of time** — independent of geography, politics, or legacy calendars.

> It is not just a clock.  
> It is a provable timeline.  
> A **truth architecture** for humanity.

## 🧬 Why It Matters

-   **Time is subjective.** Even atomic time drifts and disagrees across systems.
-   **History is mutable.** Systems can lie, omit, or rewrite the past.
-   **Trust is broken.** Decentralization alone isn’t enough — it needs verifiability.

**Temporal Cryptophysics solves this.**  
By anchoring time itself into a **signed, append-only ledger** — the [HodeauxLedger](https://github.com/spark-86/hodeauxledger) — every event is cryptographically linked to a universal, shared origin:

## 🔭 The Core Concepts

-   **Genesis Time (GT)** — A sidereal-clock-based timestamping system with 1000 base-10 `marks` per planetary rotation ("Turn"), encoded as floats. Example: `GT[0.05.12@400]`
-   **The Ledger as Time Crystal** — A structure where the _entire record of time is immutable, transparent, and reproducible_
-   **R⬢ Protocol** — A signed transport and addressing layer for records, scopes, and identities
-   **SelfID** — A sovereign identity architecture layered into the timeline
-   **VeroScope** — An emerging AI layer to interpret, verify, and simulate from the ledger itself

## 🚀 Why Now?

Because someone had to do it.  
Because time, as we know it, was **lying**.  
Because the future needs **_proof_**.

And now it has one.
